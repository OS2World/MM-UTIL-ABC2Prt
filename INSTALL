How to install abc2prt
----------------------

1. Linux and other Unices
-------------------------

Login as root, unpack the archive, and type

  # make; make install

This will install abc2prt in /usr/local/bin.

On Red Hat and derivatives, you can build an .rpm for abc2prt with this
command:

  # rpm -ta abc2prt-1.0.0.tar.gz
  
Then find out where the .rpm was created (e.g. /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/),
and install it as usual:
  
  # rpm -i abc2prt-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm


2. Windows
----------

Get the binary package and unpack it. Copy ABC2PRT.EXE to a directory
included in the PATH. Confused? C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT will do.

Done!
