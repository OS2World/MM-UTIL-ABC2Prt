 abc2prt 1.0.2
---------------


abc2prt is a simple tool to extract parts from multivoice ABC music files.

I wrote it because it's often desirable to give singers their own part in
addition to the complete score. I know that Perl scripts exist that do the
trick, and Unix users will be happy with them. However, installing Perl on a
Windows machine for running such a script only is quite an overkill.

abc2prt is a command line tool. Usage is

  $ abc2prt -v voicename [inputfile] [outputfile]

If inputfile and outputfile are not specified, abc2prt will use standard
input and standard output. An example is

  $ abc2prt -v TII music.abc music-tii.abc

which will output the whole header and all the lines that belong to the
voice defined as V:TII, including w: lines. Try abc2prt with the enclosed
file 101best.abc, taken from the jaabc2ps archive
(http://www.guitarnut.com/abc/index.html).

There can be up to 4 -v switches.

If there's enough request, I'll write a graphical version.
